## Segment Tree
I have implemented two variations of segment tree
* ArrayBasedSegmentTree - A balanced binary tree of segments backed by an array. While optimized for queries, it is limited by the max value of range since, we need to store all the elements in the range.
* DynamicSegmentTree - 

### Dynamic Segment Tree 

## Suffix Array

## B Tree

## Disjoint Set

## Bloom Filter
