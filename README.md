# Data structures
My attempt to write some of the interesting data structures in Rust

## Segment Tree
I have implemented two variations of segment tree

* ArrayBasedSegmentTree - A balanced binary tree of segments backed by an array. While optimized for queries, it is limited by the max value of range since, we need to store all the elements in the range.
* DynamicSegmentTree - A balanced binary tree of segments in a tree structure. It is dynamic because nodes are created on demand. 

Used these data structures to solve a few problems  on leet code. 



### Dynamic Segment Tree 

## Suffix Array

## B Tree

## Disjoint Set

## Bloom Filter
